# Basic-Portfolio
The beginnings of my coding career

each site has a header with separate boxes that separate name, and links that connect each site, fonts according to recommended directions

each site has a footer at the bottom according to the specifications

About me page has a main body centered, width 960px, several paragraphs about why I love LA, a picture to the left 

Portfolio page has pictures of my projects, along with text in the middle of each container, with a background on the text

Contact page has text boxes with labels, writing inside of the boxes is possible, submit button does not lead anywhere (not sure how to do that yet)

Problems: 

the links "about, portfolio" are the same, the link "contact" causes the page to slightly move towards the right, I'm not sure why

Could not find out how to make the pictures in "portfolio" section to evenly distribute across the main container

the "main" has main1, main2, main3, one for each page, because I couldn't figure out how to get the height to correspond to how much content is in its box

Some of the padding needs to be redone to make the littler details more aesthetic
